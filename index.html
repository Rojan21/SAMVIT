      <h1>About Samvit 2.0</h1>
      <p class="content">St Berchmans College has always remained on the forefront of higher education in Kerala. As it
        completes the
        100
        year of
        growth, we have much to feel proud of and so much to remember. SB has grown through the years establishing a
        tradition
        of excellence crossing many hurdles, As part of the Centenary Celebrations of the college, several academic and
        cultural
        programmes are being organized through the year. A unique academic programme planned to popularize science and
        our
        rich
        cultural heritage among the public is SAMVIT 2.0 (National Level Science and Cultural Exhibition). The
        exhibition
        will
        be conducted from 19 to 25 September 2022 in specially designed pavilions on the prolific campus of the college.
